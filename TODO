$ shortcut for shell commands

Don't require the full target filename with link, specifying a
directory should be enough.

link command should be smart enough to use absolute paths were
appropriate.

link command: support globs to create multiple links.

link command - document the -f switch (or someting different, it's ugly)

shell commands: cd into the yaml dir.

What if we want to add a line to a file (echo >>), but only if it's
not already in there?
