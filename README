wsconfig
========

A tiny utility to auto-configure a workstation. The idea is, put your
configuration file into Dropbox, and use this tool to have them linked into
the proper locations, along with the installation of some packages you need.

Written for Unix systems, but might be useful on Windows.


Configuration
-------------

This works with a YAML configuration file::

    _wine:
        - dpkg: wine
        - shell: wine corporeal-setup.exe

    base:
        - <wine?>
        - dpkg: vim thunderbird
        - remind: Configure custom monospace font
        - link: forward ~/.forward
        - link: ssh/config .ssh/config

    dev:
        - <base>
        - dpkg: git python-setuptools python-dev mercurial php5-cgi php5-xdebug
        - shell: easy_install pip
        - pip: virtualenv virtualenvwrapper bzr
        - mkdir: ~/Development ~/Development/projects


The basic structure is::

    package:
        - plugin: arguments


When executing ``wsconfig``, it will ask you what package to apply. In the
example, extra configuration takes place for a machine used for development.

The plugin command are always executed in order.

A package may include another package by using the <>-syntax. By suffixing
the include instruction with a question mark, it becomes an optional
dependency that you will be queried about::

     - <another_package>
     - <optional_package?>


If a package definition is prefixed with an underscore like the ``wine``
package above, it will not be offered as an installation choice. This is for
packages you want to use via includes only.


Available plugins
-----------------

dpkg
    Install dpkg packages on Debian-systems, using apt-get.

link
    Create a symbolic link. Both pathnames should be relative to the YAML
    file itself, wsconfig will properly construct the link target path.

shell
    Execute a shell command.

mkdir
    Creates a directory, if it does't exist yet.

pip
    Install a Python package using "pip". pip needs to be available.

wine
    Run a windows executable via wine.

remind
    Remind yourself of some manual setup step. These will be collected and
    presented at the end of the script.
